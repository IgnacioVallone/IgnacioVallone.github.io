<p>In 1984, the Chicago Bulls selected Michael Jordan as the third overall pick in the NBA Draft.
  Big men Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers)
  were selected before Jordan, mainly because teams back then prioritized centers more than guards. </p>

  <p>While contract negotiations were progressing with the Bulls,
    Nike was working on its own deal with Jordan. There were several key people involved in the negotiations.
    The story is complex and much-disputed, but as told by Sonny Vaccaro, a shady marketing agent who signed
     up college basketball coaches to Nike, he convinced Swoosh marketing
     director Rob Strasser that Jordan was worth signing at any cost.</p>

    <p>The Air Jordan 1 didn’t retro until 1995, with the return of the “Chicago” and “Bred” colorways.
      Sneaker trends had moved on to more technical models and there wasn't yet any retro market to speak of.
      The re-release was a dismal failure,
       with shoes reportedly being put on sale for a reduced price of $20 (down from $80). </p>

     <p>Jordan Brand waited until 2001 to try its luck again, this time releasing the shoe
       in a new mid-top shape. Since then, interest has exploded, with countless
       Air Jordan 1 colorways and variants popping up, making it one of the most popular sneakers of all time.</p>

       <p>The “Chicago,” “Black Toe,” and “Bred” Air Jordan 1s remain the most significant
         models due to their OG status, appearances on the court, and the exposure they received
         through advertising, on TV, and in the media in general. They will always be regarded as
          grails in the sneaker community, forever synonymous not only with streetwear and style, but, of course,
         His Airness himself — the skinny North Carolina guard who rose from precocious NBA rookie to the GOAT.</p>
